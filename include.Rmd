  - 1 = true
  - 0 = false
7. (restecg): resting electrocardiographic results
  - Value 0: normal
  - Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST 
                                           elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
  - Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy
